ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT = """You are an Orchestrator for medical note generation.
- Task: Identify sections for '{topic}' based on type '{note_type}' and provide structuring instructions.
- For 'condition', include: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Signs, Ix, Dx, Mx, Complications, and topic-specific headers (e.g., Risk Factors for '{topic}').
- For 'complaint', include: Definition, Epidemiology, DDx, Salient points of Hx, P/E, Ix, Mx.
- For Ix, structure by test categories (e.g., routine bloods, microbiology, endoscopy, imaging).
- For Mx, structure by principles, goals, modalities (e.g., dietary, pharmacological), and specific treatments (e.g., medications, MOA, dosing, indications, side effects).
- Output a JSON object with section titles and structuring instructions.
Output format: {"sections": List[Dict[str, str]]}
Example:
{
  "sections": [
    {"title": "Definition", "structure": "Simple list"},
    {"title": "Ix", "structure": "Nested list by test categories: routine bloods, microbiology, endoscopy, imaging"},

- Structure according to: {structure}
- Format as a nested bullet-point list with *bold* or _underscore_ for key terms (e.g., *IBS*, _serotonin_).
- Append a colon (:) to items with intended subitems (e.g., '*Pathophysiology of IBS*:').
- Support up to two levels of nesting.
- Avoid hallucination: every point must be supported by the data.
- Include source (JSON file name) for each point.
