ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT = """You are an Orchestrator for medical note generation in a Zettelkasten format.
Task: Identify sections for a medical note on the topic '{topic}' based on type '{note_type}' (e.g., 'condition' or 'complaint'). Use the provided data to inform section choices:
{data}

Instructions:
- For 'condition', prioritize these sections if relevant to the data: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Signs, Investigations (Ix), Diagnosis (Dx), Management (Mx), Complications, and topic-specific headers (e.g., 'Risk Factors for {topic}').
- For 'complaint', prioritize these sections if relevant to the data: Definition, Epidemiology, Differential Diagnosis (DDx), Salient Points of History (Hx), Physical Examination (P/E), Investigations (Ix), Management (Mx).
- For Investigations (Ix), structure as a nested list by test categories (e.g., routine bloods, microbiology, endoscopy, imaging).
- For Management (Mx), structure as a nested list by principles, goals, modalities (e.g., dietary, pharmacological), and specific treatments (e.g., medications, mechanism of action, dosing, indications, side effects).
- Only include sections supported by the data or highly relevant to the topic and note type. Add topic-specific sections (e.g., 'Initial Drug Therapy for {topic}') if the data suggests them.
- For each section, determine complexity:
  - 'simple': Sections with concise, flat lists (e.g., Definition, Epidemiology), typically requiring minimal subtopics.
  - 'complex': Sections with detailed, nested lists (e.g., Investigations, Management), typically involving subcategories or hierarchies.
  - Base complexity primarily on structure (e.g., 'nested', 'hierarchy', 'by category' imply complex; 'simple list' implies simple).
  - Use title semantics as a fallback (e.g., titles like 'Definition' or 'Overview' are simple; 'Treatment' or 'Symptoms' are complex).
- Output a JSON object with a 'sections' key containing an array of section objects, each with 'title', 'structure', and 'complexity' fields.
- Ensure the output is valid JSON with the exact structure: {{"sections": [{{"title": "string", "structure": "string", "complexity": "string"}}, ...]}}

PARSE_STRUCTURE_PROMPT = """
You are an expert note-taker responsible for identifying questions to research the medical topic '{topic}' for the section '{section_title}'. 
You are tasked to generate queries with an eye to the section’s structure: '{section_structure}'.
Your goal is to craft concise, specific questions that will guide the retrieval of relevant information for the section’s focus.
- If the structure is simple (e.g., 'Simple list'), generate a single general question about the section.
- If the structure is complex (e.g., 'Nested list by risk factor category: age, genetics, lifestyle, environment'), identify the subtopics or categories (e.g., 'age', 'genetics') and generate a question for each, plus a general question for the section.
- Ensure questions are natural and focused, like those a diligent researcher would ask (e.g., 'What is the role of genetics in hypertension risk factors?').
- Output a JSON object with a 'queries' field containing an array of question strings.

Output JSON schema:

Example for simple section 'Definition' with structure 'Simple list':

{{
  "queries": [
    "What are the risk factors for primary hypertension?",
    "What is the role of age in hypertension risk factors?",

You are an expert note-taker evaluating a text chunk for '{topic}', section '{section_title}' with structure '{section_structure}'.
Based on the query '{query}', decide if the chunk is relevant to '{section_title}' of {topic}.

- Provide a brief reason for your judgment.
Output JSON:
- is_relevant: True if relevant, False otherwise.

SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are a medical note-taker creating Org-mode notes for '{topic}', section '{section_title}' with structure '{section_structure}'. You are given some relevant context, with the sources in square brackets ([source name]).
Summarize the context into a concise bullet-point list:
- Follow '{section_structure}' (e.g., 'Simple list' or 'Nested list by category: symptoms, signs').
- Use Org-mode: *bold* or _underscore_ for key terms (e.g., *Hypertension*, _Dyspnoea_).
- Append colon (:) to items with subitems (e.g., '- *Symptoms*:').
- Support up to two nesting levels.
- Include [source] for each point (e.g., [file.json]).
- Use 'quote' for direct citations.
- Ground all points in context; no hallucination.
- If no content, use '- No relevant content [Unknown]'.

Context:
{context}

Output JSON (NoteSection schema):
- title: '{section_title}'.
- content: Array of NoteItem or strings.
- source: Comma-separated sources or 'Unknown'.

Example for 'Clinical Features' (Simple list):

VALIDATION_PROMPT = """
You are a medical note-taker reviewing a Zettelkasten-style Org-mode summary for '{topic}', section '{section_title}' with structure '{section_structure}' and complexity '{section_complexity}'.
Your task is to:
1. Check for hallucination: Ensure each NoteItem.text and NoteItem.quote is grounded in the context (i.e., appears in a chunk).
2. Verify structure: Confirm the summary follows '{section_structure}' (e.g., includes all subtopics like 'symptoms, signs' for nested lists).
3. Check formatting: Ensure Org-mode syntax with '- ' for bullets, *bold* or _underscore_ for key terms, [source] for each point, colon (:) for items with subitems, and two-space indent for subitems.
4. Identify gaps: List missing subtopics from '{section_structure}' (e.g., 'signs' not covered).
5. Generate follow-up questions: Create concise queries to address gaps.

Context:
